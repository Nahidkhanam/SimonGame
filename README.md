# Simon Game ðŸŽ®ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ¨

## Project Overview :

This project is a **web-based Simon Game**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It is inspired by the classic electronic memory game **Simon**, where users have to remember and repeat a sequence of colors.  
The main goal was to practice **JavaScript event handling**, **DOM manipulation**, and **game logic building** in web development.

## Features :

- **Interactive Gameplay:**  
  Players need to repeat the growing sequence of colors shown by the game.

- **Keyboard Start:**  
  The game starts when the user presses any key.

- **Sequence Generation:**  
  Every new level adds one more color to the sequence.

- **User Input Validation:**  
  The game checks the player's input at each step and provides feedback on mistakes.

- **Game Over and Restart:**  
  On wrong input, the game shows a "Game Over" animation and waits for the next keypress to restart.

- **Basic Animations & Sounds:**  
  Visual feedback and sound effects make the game engaging.

## Technologies Used :

- **HTML:**  
  For structuring the web page content.

- **CSS:**  
  For styling the game layout and buttons.

- **JavaScript:**  
  For handling game logic, event handling, animations, and sequence tracking.

## Project Purpose :

This project serves as a **learning exercise** to build skills in **JavaScript programming**, **game logic development**, and **interactive web design**.  
It helped in understanding **event listeners**, **arrays**, **timing functions**, and **DOM manipulation**.
